# React Template

This is a slightly modified version of the [Create Vite template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react). Most of the non-boilerplate code has been removed, such as Vite assets, styles, and the starting counter app. This template is meant to be a starting point for building Guided Practices and Workshops.
